J65el02
---

A Java implementation of the 65el02 CPU.

# About

The CPU implementation is based on the [Symon](https://github.com/sethm/symon) 6502 system simulator.

It has been adapted for 16-bit operations and the new opcodes introduced in 65el02.

The implementation for some instructions is based on the [emu65el02](http://bigfootinformatika.hu/65el02/) emulator.
